                              <p>Hi, I'm Gizem, a software engineering student passionate about web development. 
                                 My journey started with an interest in designing user-friendly and visually appealing websites. 
                                 I enjoy learning new tools and technologies that help bring creative ideas to life. 
                                 Through this course, I aim to improve my front-end development skills and build a strong foundation in web design.
                              </p>

                              <p>I am currently developing key skills in designing and creating web pages. 
                                 I have learned how to work with HTML and CSS to structure and style web content, 
                                 as well as how to use design software to create visually appealing layouts. 
                                 I also learned how to make sure my code is correct by using online validators.
                                 With CSS, I can change colors, fonts, and layouts to improve the design of a website. 
                                 Such as W3C HTML Validator and W3C CSS Validator.
                                 Currently this project have strengethened my technical skills and provide hands-on experience in web development and design.</p>

                              <p>When working on debugging, it is better to use the W3C HTML Validator and W3C CSS Validator to check the code and make sure it is correct. 
                                 These tools help identify errors such as unclosed tags, incorrect attributes, and CSS syntax mistakes, making it easier to fix issues efficiently.
                                 One common problem was elements not aligning properly due to incorrect flexbox and grid settings. To fix this, I used the browser's developer tools to inspect the layout and adjust the CSS rules. 
                                 Another issue was broken links and missing images, which happened because of incorrect file paths.
                                 Checking and updating the directory structure helped resolve this.
                                 For validation, it is important to test the code using W3C validators to ensure it meets web standards and works correctly across different browsers and devices. 
                                 After making the necessary fixes, the final validation confirmed that the webpages were error-free, responsive, and fully functional.
                              </p>
