                              <p>Hi, I'm Gizem, a software engineering student passionate about web development. 
                                 My journey started with an interest in designing user-friendly and visually appealing websites. 
                                 I enjoy learning new tools and technologies that help bring creative ideas to life. 
                                 Through this course, I aim to improve my front-end development skills and build a strong foundation in web design.
                              </p>
                           
                              <p>As a beginner in web development, I have explored HTML and CSS to structure and style webpages effectively.  
                                 I am fascinated by how small design choices can impact user experience and accessibility.  
                                 My goal is to create websites that are not only functional but also engaging and intuitive for users.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>Beyond coding, I also enjoy problem-solving and debugging, which are essential skills in development.  
                                 Understanding how to fix errors and optimize code helps build reliable and efficient websites.  
                                 As I progress in my learning journey, I look forward to mastering JavaScript, responsive design, and more advanced front-end frameworks.
                              </p>
                          
                              <p>This portfolio showcases my learning process, projects, and improvements in web design.  
                                 Each section highlights different aspects of my development journey, from basic HTML structure to styling techniques and debugging practices.  
                                 I am excited to continue growing my skills and applying them to real-world projects.
                              </p>

                              <p>I am currently developing key skills in designing and creating web pages. 
                                 I have learned how to work with HTML and CSS to structure and style web content, 
                                 as well as how to use design software to create visually appealing layouts. 
                                 I also learned how to make sure my code is correct by using online validators.
                                 With CSS, I can change colors, fonts, and layouts to improve the design of a website. 
                                 Such as W3C HTML Validator and W3C CSS Validator.
                                 Currently this project have strengethened my technical skills and provide hands-on experience in web development and design.</p>
                              
                                 <p>With CSS, I can customize colors, fonts, and layouts to enhance the visual appeal of a website.  
                                    Learning about flexbox** and grid has helped me create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.  
                                    I also experimented with CSS animations and transitions to add interactivity and improve user experience.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Additionally, I have explored basic JavaScript concepts to add functionality to web pages,  
                                    such as handling user interactions and dynamic content updates.  
                                    Understanding how JavaScript works with the DOM (Document Object Model) has given me insight into creating more interactive websites.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>One of my projects involved designing a personal portfolio website, where I applied my knowledge of HTML and CSS  
                                    to create a structured, visually appealing, and accessible layout.  
                                    This project strengthened my technical skills and provided hands-on experience in web development and design.
                                 </p>

                              <p>When working on debugging, it is better to use the W3C HTML Validator and W3C CSS Validator to check the code and make sure it is correct. 
                                 These tools help identify errors such as unclosed tags, incorrect attributes, and CSS syntax mistakes, making it easier to fix issues efficiently.
                                 One common problem was elements not aligning properly due to incorrect flexbox and grid settings. To fix this, I used the browser's developer tools to inspect the layout and adjust the CSS rules. 
                                 <p>Another issue was broken links and missing images, which happened because of incorrect file paths.
                                 Checking and updating the directory structure helped resolve this.
                                 For validation, it is important to test the code using W3C validators to ensure it meets web standards and works correctly across different browsers and devices. 
                                 After making the necessary fixes, the final validation confirmed that the webpages were error-free, responsive, and fully functional.
                              </p>

                              <p>Another issue I faced was broken links and missing images, which occurred due to incorrect file paths.  
                                 I learned the importance of organizing the project directory correctly and testing all links and image paths to ensure they point to the right locations.  
                                 After correcting the paths, all the links and images loaded properly, and the layout looked much better.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>To ensure the final product met the necessary standards, I ran the code through the **W3C Validators** to confirm that there were no errors.  
                                 After making the necessary fixes, the validators confirmed that the webpages were error-free, responsive, and fully functional across all browsers and devices.  
                                 This process helped me improve the overall quality of the website and ensured it met both technical and aesthetic requirements.</p>
