# Web Development Process Portfolio

Welcome to my Web Development Portfolio! This project showcases my journey through the Web Design Tools course. The portfolio serves as a personal introduction to my skills, projects, and debugging processes while emphasizing my understanding of HTML, CSS, file management, and debugging skills.

## Project Structure

The project follows the structure outlined in the assignment to ensure proper organization and validation of code.

web-dev-process/ 
├── index.html 
├── css/ 
│ └── style.css 
├── images/ 
│ └── [Image Files]

### Files Included

1. **index.html**: The main HTML file where I structured the content of my portfolio.
2. **css/style.css**: The external CSS file used for styling the portfolio page.
3. **images/**: Directory containing any images used in the project (e.g., profile pictures, project screenshots).

## Portfolio Page Content

### Introduction

In this section, I’ve written a brief overview of myself, highlighting my background, interests, and aspirations in web development. I aimed to make it personal and engaging, using narrative elements to provide insight into my journey.

### Skills and Projects

This section highlights key skills I’ve acquired in the Web Design Tools course and demonstrates them through examples of my work, including completed assignments and relevant experiences.

### Debugging and Validation Report

Here, I’ve summarized my debugging process and validation results. I discussed the issues I encountered during the project, how I resolved them, and the outcome of the validation tests I ran. This includes the results of running my code through the W3C HTML Validator, W3C CSS Validator, and the WAVE Accessibility Checker.

### Footer Content

I’ve included a footer with a copyright notice, an external link to a relevant website of my choice, and a mailto link to my email for easy contact.

## Part I: Project Setup

I created a directory named `web-dev-process` and followed the directory structure outlined above. The root directory contains the `index.html` file and the `css` folder, which holds the `style.css` file.

### Initial HTML File

In `index.html`, I included the necessary structure: 
- The DOCTYPE declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- A comment in the `<head>` section with my full name and course name.

## Part II: HTML Structure and Content

### Semantic Structure Elements

I’ve used semantic HTML5 tags such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, and `<aside>` to structure the page properly and ensure readability and accessibility.

### Content and Structure

- **Page Title**: I used a `<h1>` element to define the title of my page.
- **Subheadings**: I’ve included `<h2>` and `<h3>` elements for clear organization and sectioning.
- **Lists**: I’ve used `<ul>` and `<ol>` elements to organize key information.
- **Image**: I included an image (stored in the `images/` folder) to make the page more personal.

### Navigation Menu

I created a navigation menu using the `<nav>` element, which links to the major sections of the page. The links use same-page destination links (e.g., `href="#skills"`).

### Debugging Report

The `<aside>` element contains a detailed debugging and validation report, where I summarized the errors I encountered, how I resolved them, and the results from the validation tools.

## Part III: CSS Styling

### External Style Sheet

I linked an external CSS file (`style.css`) to my `index.html` page to separate content and presentation.

### Styling Details

- I created a complementary color scheme for the background and text colors for the `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<nav>`.
- I defined font weights, sizes, and decorations for the page content.
- I styled links with appropriate colors for different pseudo-classes (e.g., `:hover`).
- At least one CSS class is used to style an additional element to enhance the design.

### Accessibility Considerations

I made sure to:
- Enhance readability by choosing readable font sizes.
- Ensure sufficient contrast between the text and background colors.
- Avoid color contrast errors that might affect users with visual impairments.

## Part IV: Debugging and Validation

### Debugging Process

I used browser Developer Tools to inspect and fix issues in both HTML and CSS:
- I tested styles and ensured consistent rendering across browsers.
- I resolved issues with semantic structure and visual presentation.

### Validation

I validated my HTML and CSS code with the following tools:
- **W3C HTML Validator**: Ensured the structure and syntax of the HTML code were error-free.
- **W3C CSS Validator**: Checked the correctness of the CSS code.
- **WAVE Accessibility Checker**: Verified that my page was accessible for users with disabilities.

## Part V: Version Control and Deployment

### Version Control

I initialized a Git repository in my project folder and committed all project files with meaningful commit messages to track my progress and changes.

### Deployment

I pushed my repository to GitHub and deployed my site using GitHub Pages for live access.

## Submission

Once the project was complete, I submitted the following:
1. GitHub repository link: [https://gizemgiz.github.io/Web-Dev-Process/](#)
2. Live GitHub Pages site: [https://github.com/GizemGiz/Web-Dev-Process.git](#)

## Conclusion

This project allowed me to apply HTML, CSS, and debugging skills to create a visually appealing, accessible, and well-structured portfolio. I learned a lot about best practices in web development and the importance of validation for creating error-free and accessible web pages.
